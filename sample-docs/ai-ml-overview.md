# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that aims to create 
intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms that can learn 
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

### Machine Learning Types
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labels  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment

### Popular Applications
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Autonomous Vehicles  
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection

## Future Prospects

The field of AI continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs in deep learning,
neural networks, and cognitive computing. As we advance, ethical considerations and
responsible AI development become increasingly important.

The integration of AI into various industries promises to revolutionize how we work,
communicate, and solve complex problems. However, it also raises important questions
about employment, privacy, and the role of human intelligence in an AI-driven world.
